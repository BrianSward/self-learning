## Intro to Deep Learning (part 2)

### Overview

- Following [this class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHGMqK3pFoY) on Deep Learning

### Title: What is Deep Learning, how it works, why it works and why now?

### Topics Covered Today:

- AI vs ML vs DL
    - AI: 1950s - Any tech which enables machines to mimic human behavior
    - ML: 1980s - Subset of AI, enables computers to learn from data. model is trained using algos
    - DL: 2010s - Subset of ML, extracts patterns from data using nural networks (a "black box" to us currently)
- What is Deep Learning?
    - ML process that uses multiple layers of neurons working as a network to process data and make some output
    - **GOAL :** To build models that can automatically learn complex patterns from data and make predications
- It learns via networks
- Examples of networks
    - Standard NN
    - Convolutional NN
    - Recurrant NN
    - Transformers
- How does Deep Learning work?
    - The network will use a series of interconnected layers by transforming the data and passing it on to the next layer
    - The final layer will produce the output
    - the network will then adjust the difference between predicted and true and repeated until learned to then be able to make predicitions on new data
- Why Deep Learning?
    - the model is not programming explicitly. instead it LEARNS to recognize the patter from the data in a hierarchical data.
    - Feature extraction and classification is done at same time
