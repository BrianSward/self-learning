## Deep Learning Concepts

### Overview

- Following this [Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2GWo47BFyUO6Fiy2mJCxR8sUrBEfT6BM) on Deep Learning

### Setting up Deep Learning Environment

### Topics Covered Today:

#### Env Set Up

- Install using Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
  - allows you to make diff enviroments to handle package managing
- Install JupyterLab [here](http://jupyter.org/install)
  - follow install instructions here
  - JupyterLab is stronger version of Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  - Nice, we already had this covered
- Google colab [here](https://colab.google.com)
  - also got this covered as well
  - pros, comes installed with things like tensorflow and scikit
  - allows you to use gpu/tpu processing

#### Packages We'll Use
