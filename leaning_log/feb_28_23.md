## GraphQL

### Overview

- Followed [this guide](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/graphql/python/complete-api-guide/) on how to set up a GraphQL server using Python

### Take Away

- Wow, was there a lot to figure out when setting up something outside of coding school. There we had sorta vetted applications, now, wow, all bets are off and if things are any older than a few months they are prob not going to work smoothly.
- Ended up getting half way through the set up, going to continue working on it tomorrow.
